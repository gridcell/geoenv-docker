GeoEnv Docker
-------------

GeoEnv is for those that don't want to create a geospatial development environment before you can test out some code you wrote, convert some spatial data or hack on an idea.

Build the docker image yourself or `docker pull gridcell/geoenv`

## What about X?

If something that you deem worthwhile to be included in the docker image, create an issue or submit a pull request.


## Companion CLI

A companion to the GeoEnv docker image is the [GeoEnv cli](https://github.com/gridcell/geoenv-cli) so you can get start and not have to remember all the docker run/exec settings :).

* Start a bash environment quickly
* Include a linked PostgreSQL/PostGIS container
* Spin up a Jupyter notebook
